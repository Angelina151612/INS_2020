contains spoilers! i can't believe what i did watch here. this is nothing compared to the other 4 movies. this movie is solely based around the new female feme lead. and this new character is a annoying, loud, know it all, arrogant, does never anything wrong or with consequence and finds the treasure for only one reason, because she is a women, literally! no joke! she brings nothing of value to the group except her sex, she b*tches around the whole movie, makes fun in a very discriminating way of all established characters, emphasizes all the way how dumb pirates and all other established characters are. of course they play every known annoying cliche feme trope from the book. Jack Sparrow on the other hand is only there to goof around. He has no importance to the plot what so ever. In the other films he is the guy with a genius crazy plot and plan. But in this movie he is just there to look drunk and stupid so the feme lead looks good. They could have made this movie completely without Jack Sparrow, you wouldnt even notice. Pirates of the caribbean is a movie franchise which is based around pirate cliches and overexaggeration of those cliches, playing dumb is part of the fun. Having a new character doing nothing else than making fun of those cliches and dumbness and at the same time beeing reality-like-serious about things does make this movie a demontage of itself. In the end they kill off a charismatic lead character in favor of the new character in a plot which was sidelined the whole movie and then out of the sudden should be important. please no more potc movies. this franchise is over with those current filmmakers.
